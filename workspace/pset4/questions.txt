    GIF: 8 bits, 256 colors.
    JPEG: 24 bit, 16777216 colors.

1.  GIF and APNG
2.  Lossy, looses some data and cannot be restored to its orinial complete form.  Lossless can be restored to its original form.
3.  JPEG and GIF, PNG is designed as lossless, but some are of the opinion that it is lossy
4.  "When the operating system erases a FAT file, two
things occur. First, the system modifies the filename’s first
character in the file’s directory entry to signal that the file
has been deleted and that the directory entry can be recycled.
Second, the system moves all of the file’s FAT clusters
to the hard drive’s list of free clusters. The actual file
data is never touched. Indeed, there are many programs
available that can recover erased files."

5.  Smash the hard drive with a hammer then burn it with an acetylene torch on top of a powerful electromagnet. 
6.  stdint.h is a header file in the C standard library that allows programmers to write more portable code by 
providing a set of typedefs that specify exact-width integer types.
7.  To create variables of a specific length.  In the case of this program, these are used in structs that have 
been packed.  These structs are used to read/write data from a bmp file.
8.  BYTE 1
    DWORD 4
    LONG 4
    WORD 2
9.  0x424d according to dump and web or 4d42 according to peek and check in copy.c
10. bfsize is the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file.  bisize is the size of the structure.
11. The bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner.
12. biBitCount
13. No disk space or no permission
14. Because we only want to read one element at a time.
15. 3
16. The  fseek()  function  sets  the  file  position indicator for the stream.
17. SEEK_CUR is the current position indicator.
